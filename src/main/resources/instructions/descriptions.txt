game-mode-host=Host a game for up to 4 players, including yourself.
As the host, you'll be running a host server to receive and send data to the guests.
You will also connect and send word queries to the game server - which is responsible
for checking wheather a word is dictionary legal in the game books terms.

game-mode-guest=Join an existing game hosted by another player.
As a guest, you'll connect to the host's server and participate as one of the players.
Enjoy the multiplayer experience without hosting the game.
game-flow-rules=1. Each player randomly draws a tile from the bag.
2. The order of the players is determined by the order of the letters drawn(from smallest to largest).
    - If an empty tile is drawn, it is returned to the bag, and another one is drawn.
3. All the tiles are returned to the bag.
4. Each player randomly draws 7 tiles.
5. The first player (the one who drew the smallest letter in the lottery) has to form a legal word
   that passes through the central slot (the star) on the board.
    - Only he gets a double score for it.
    - He replenishes his tiles from the bag to have 7 tiles again.
6. Gradually, each player, in turn, assembles a legal word from the tiles in their possession.
    - Like in a crossword puzzle, each word must rest on one of the tiles on the board.
    - After writing the word, the player adds 7 tiles from the bag.
    - Their score is accumulated based on all the words created on the board following
      the placement of the tiles.
        - Tiles placed on double or triple letter squares will be doubled or tripled in value accordingly.
        - The word then receives the sum of the tile value.
        - This amount will be doubled or tripled for each doubling or tripling word slot
           that the tiles are superimposed on
          (e.g., it is possible to multiply by 4 or 9 if the word took
           two double word or triple word slots, respectively).
        - The above calculation is true for every new word created on the board
          following the placement in turn.
7. A player who cannot form a valid word forfeits their turn.
8. The game ends when there are no more tiles to draw from the bag,
or after several unsuccessful rounds.
