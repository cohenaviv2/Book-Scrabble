game-mode-host=In Host Mode, you can host a game for up to 4 players, including yourself.
As the host, you'll be running a host server to send and receive data to the guests.
You will also connect and send word queries to the game server - which is responsible
for checking wheather a word is dictionary legal in the game books terms.

game-mode-guest=In Guest Mode, you'll be joining an existing game hosted by another player.
As a guest, you connect to the host's server and participate as one of the players.
Guest mode allows you to enjoy the multiplayer experience without hosting the game.
host-mode=In Host Mode,  you're in charge.
As the host, you manage a game server right on your machine.
This means that you'll be running a host server to connects you with up to 3 guests,
forming a group of 4 players including you.

Imagine it as your personal hub in your own space.
You're not just a player; you're the server admin.
Your role is to ensure everyone connects and communicates smoothly on your local setup.

But that's not all. You also connect to a game server responsible for checking word legality.
This separate server ensures fair play and maintains dictionary standards.

Choose Host Mode, take control locally, and link up to 3 players to your game hub for multiplayer excitement.
guest-mode=In Guest Mode, you're a player on the move.
As a guest, you connect to the host server to jump into the game.
To get started, you'll need the host's IP address.

Simply input the host's IP, and you're in.
No hosting, no setup. Just plug in and play.
Guest Mode lets you join the action and experience multiplayer excitement.
game-flow-rules=1. Each player randomly draws a tile from the bag.
2. The order of the players is determined by the order of the letters drawn(from smallest to largest).
    - If an empty tile is drawn, it is returned to the bag, and another one is drawn.
3. All the tiles are returned to the bag.
4. Each player randomly draws 7 tiles.
5. The first player (the one who drew the smallest letter in the lottery) has to form a legal word
   that passes through the central slot (the star) on the board.
    - Only he gets a double score for it.
    - He replenishes his tiles from the bag to have 7 tiles again.
6. Gradually, each player, in turn, assembles a legal word from the tiles in their possession.
    - Like in a crossword puzzle, each word must rest on one of the tiles on the board.
    - After writing the word, the player adds 7 tiles from the bag.
    - Their score is accumulated based on all the words created on the board following
      the placement of the tiles.
        - Tiles placed on double or triple letter squares will be doubled or tripled in value accordingly.
        - The word then receives the sum of the tile value.
        - This amount will be doubled or tripled for each doubling or tripling word slot
           that the tiles are superimposed on
          (e.g., it is possible to multiply by 4 or 9 if the word took
           two double word or triple word slots, respectively).
        - The above calculation is true for every new word created on the board
          following the placement in turn.
7. A player who cannot form a valid word forfeits their turn.
8. The game will end after N rounds.
