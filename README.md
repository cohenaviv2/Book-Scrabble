# Development

The Book Scrabble game is a desktop application developed in Java, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure a smooth experience for users and effective data handling. With its user-friendly JavaFX interface, the game provides an engaging and visually appealing environment for players.

### The Model

The model in the Book Scrabble app is divided into two parts: the Host Model and the Guest Model, both implementing the game model interface. <br>The Host Model manages the game, communicates with guests through a Host Server and Guest Handler, and interacts separately with the Game Server for word legality checks.<br> The communication between the host and the guest is facilitated through a custom-defined protocol, with objects being transferred using Java's Serializable interface. <br> Meanwhile, the Guest Model connects to the Host Server using a socket and communicates via the straightforward Communication Handler. This division simplifies the game, providing specific functions through two different model implementations.

### The Game Server

The game server, hosted on Oracle Cloud via an Ubuntu 22.04 VM, is responsible for checking the dictionary legality of words in the Book Scrabble app. <br> It manages a pool of dictionaries, each linked to a specific book, and employs a Cache Manager with two cachesâ€”one for found words and another for unfound ones. <br> The cache management uses LRU and LFU policies, alongside a space-efficient Bloom Filter to ensures rapid  query responses. <br> Players can challenge a "false" response, triggering the server to verify using an IO Searcher that scans all books and updates relevant caches, upholding the accuracy of word legality checks.
