Book Scrabble puts a new twist on the traditional word game by replacing the standard dictionary with a collection of books, offering players a more imaginative word pool. It's an online multiplayer game where you can play with friends by hosting or joining games over the internet, creating a social gaming experience.
Use your imagination and challange the dictionary with unique words!
